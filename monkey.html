                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                       <p> Monkey are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
                           </p>
        <p> Monkey is divided into two species: the eastern monkey and the western monkey (both critically endangered), and either four
         or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. 
         lthough their range covers a small percentage of 
         Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations.</p>
                           
       <p>   The mountain monkey inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud 
         forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland monkey live in 
         dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland monkey living in Central West African 
         countries and eastern lowland monkey living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
         Monkeys' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small 
         percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, monkey cover a wide range of elevations.</p>
         
 
                         
                        <p>You will find the monkey at pen E26, right next to the lions.</p>
